**LocalAI** is a drop-in replacement REST API that's compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families that are compatible with the ggml format. Does not require GPU.

For a list of the supported model families, please see [the model compatibility table](https://localai.io/model-compatibility/index.html#model-compatibility-table).

In a nutshell:

- Local, OpenAI drop-in alternative REST API. You own your data.
- NO GPU required. NO Internet access is required either
  - Optional, GPU Acceleration is available in `llama.cpp`-compatible LLMs. See also the [build section](https://localai.io/basics/build/index.html). 
- Supports multiple models:
  - üìñ Text generation with GPTs (`llama.cpp`, `gpt4all.cpp`, ... and more)
  - üó£ Text to Audio üé∫üÜï
  - üîà Audio to Text (Audio transcription with `whisper.cpp`)
  - üé® Image generation with stable diffusion
- üèÉ Once loaded the first time, it keep models loaded in memory for faster inference
- ‚ö° Doesn't shell-out, but uses C++ bindings for a faster inference and better performance. 

LocalAI was created by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler/) and is a community-driven project, focused on making the AI accessible to anyone. Any contribution, feedback and PR is welcome! 

See the [Getting started](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/index.html) and [examples](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/) sections to learn how to use LocalAI. For a list of curated models check out the [model gallery](https://localai.io/models/).
